# armadillo-tut
A getting started guide for the linear algebra c++ package [armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/)

## This guide contains:
* Creating and running 2D matrix operations
* FileIO

### Some Notes When Trying FileIO
* The HDF5 library is not installed with the Armadillo package. This must be installed manually.
* Instructions to do so are [here](https://github.com/kaashmonee/armadillo-tut/wiki/FileIO-Tips----Installing-HDF5-on-Ubuntu-18).
