There are a lot of important features that are going to be useful in a linear algebra package. We will use problem 7.9 from Mark Newman's Computational Physics book to illustrate some useful features. 

In following this example, we hope to learn about:
	* FileIO
	* Plotting
	* Armadillo's Fast Fourier Transforms package
